## Problem Statement
Traditional fitness programs fundamentally fail to recognize the critical influence of emotional states on workout experiences, resulting in a disheartening disconnect between individual needs and fitness routines. This oversight leads to chronic inconsistency in motivation and engagement, causing many individuals to abandon their fitness journeys altogether.

The pressing need for truly personalized wellness experiences that address emotional well-being has never been clearer.
